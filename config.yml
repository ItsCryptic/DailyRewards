# - DailyRewards Configuration Guide -
#
# Here's an example reward configuration.
#
# rewards:
#   "hourly":
#    name: "&9Hourly Reward"
#    delay: HOURLY
#    x: 1
#    y: 1
#   
#    items:
#      "diamond:0": 64
#      "wool:9": 32
#
#    commands: 
#    - "broadcast %player% has used his hourly reward."
#
#
# Looks complicated? Let's break it down.
# Rewards have multiple properties, an ID, a name, a delay, a position and a list of items.
#
# ID -> It's the path of your reward, in this example, "hourly", it's used to IDentify the reward in the database.
# name -> This is the name of the item, the displayed name in the GUI.
# delay -> This is the delay at which users can use it. Available: HOURLY, DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY, ONCE
# x -> The X position of the reward in the GUI. (Starts at 0)
# y -> The Y position of the reward in the GUI. (Starts at 0)
# items -> The list of items given by the reward.
# commands -> The commands to run upon redeeming.
#
# The items are defined as such:
# "material:data": count
# Example: "wool:6": 16 -> that would give 16 pink wool.
#
# The commands are defined as such:
# - "COMMAND"
# You can use the wildcard %player%
